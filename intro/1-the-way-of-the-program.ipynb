    "The goal of this tutorial is to teach you to think like a **computer scientist**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). \n",
    "- Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. \n",
    "- Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single most important skill for a computer scientist is **problem solving**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and \n",
    "express a solution clearly and accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why this chapter is called, “The way of the program.”\n",
    "On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. \n",
    "As we go along, that end will become clearer."

   "source": [
    "The programming language you will learn is Python. Python is an example of a **high-level** language; \n",
    "other high-level languages you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also **low-level languages**, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “assembly languages.”\n",
    "Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low-level languages. \n",
    "So programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. \n",
    "This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The advantages are enormous, thou.** \n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level \n",
    "language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely \n",
    "to be correct. \n",
    "Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on \n",
    "different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. \n",
    "Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. \n",
    "Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: **interpreters** and \n",
    "**compilers**. \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. \n",
    "It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The structure of an interpreter.](../images/interpreter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. \n",
    "In this context, the high-level program is called the **source code**, and the translated program \n",
    "is called the **object code** or the **executable**. \n",
    "Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The process of compilation.](../images/compiler.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is considered an _interpreted language_ because Python programs are executed by an interpreter. \n",
    "There are two ways to use the interpreter: _interactive mode_ and _script mode_. \n",
    "\n",
    "In interactive mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter displays the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> 1 + 1\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The chevron, `>>>`, is the prompt the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you type `1 + 1`, the interpreter replies `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatively**, you can store code in a file and use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file, which is called a **script**. \n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, Python scripts have names that end with `.py`."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "To execute the script, you have to tell the interpreter the name of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a script named `dinsdale.py` and you are working in a **UNIX** command window, \n",
    "you type `python dinsdale.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other development environments, the details of executing scripts are different. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find instructions for your environment at the Python web site [http://python.org]().\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in **interactive mode** is convenient for testing small pieces of code because you can type and execute them immediately. \n",
    "But for anything more than a few lines, you should save your code as a script so you can modify and execute it in the future."
