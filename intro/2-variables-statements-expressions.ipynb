    "**The `decimal` to the rescue**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `decimal` module provides support for fast correctly-rounded decimal floating point arithmetic. It offers several advantages over the float datatype.\n",
    "For Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decimal “is based on a floating-point model which was designed with people in mind, and necessarily has a paramount guiding principle – computers must provide an arithmetic that works in the same way as the arithmetic that people learn at school.” – excerpt from the decimal arithmetic specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decimal numbers can be represented exactly. In contrast, numbers like `1.1` and `2.2` do not have exact representations in binary floating point. End users typically would not expect `1.1 + 2.2` to display as `3.3000000000000003` as it does with binary floating point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The exactness carries over into arithmetic. In decimal floating point, `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3` is exactly equal to zero. In binary floating point, the result is `5.5511151231257827e-017`. While near to zero, the differences prevent reliable equality testing and differences can accumulate. For this reason, decimal is preferred in accounting applications which have strict equality invariants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike hardware based binary floating point, the decimal module has a user alterable precision (defaulting to `28` places) which can be as large as needed for a given problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The module design is centered around three concepts: the decimal number, the context for arithmetic, and signals."
