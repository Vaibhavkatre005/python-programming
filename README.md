# Python programming tutorial @ WebValley 2019

This is a concise **Python 3** programming tutorial. 

I try to show everything with simple code
examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy
words. 

This tutorial is composed in a basic part, aimed at people with no programming 
experience at all or very little programming experience, 
and an advance one for people who want to learn more about python. 

If you have programmed a lot in
the past using some other language you may want to read 
[the official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) also.

You can use Python 3.6 or any newer Python with this tutorial. 
**Don't use Python 2.** 

If you write a Python 2 program now someone will need to
convert it to Python 3 later, so it's best to just write Python 3 to
begin with. 

Python 3 code will work just fine in Python 4, so you don't
need to worry about that. Python 2 also has horrible
[Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html) problems,
so it's difficult to write Python 2 code that works correctly with
non-English characters (like π and ♫).

# Content

The tutorial consists of three main sections:

### Introduction

This section will introduce to the concept of computer programming, and to the 
very basics of the Python programming language:

1. [The Way of the Program](intro/1-the-way-of-the-program.html)
2. [Variables, Statements and Expressions](intro/2-variables-statements-expressions.html)
3. [Introduction to Functions](intro/3-intro-functions.html)
4. [Setting up an editor](intro/4-setup-editor.html)
5. [Conditional Statements](basics/5-conditionals.html)

Regardless you have already programmed before, using or not Python, 
I would suggest to take a look at this introductory section anyway. 
There is always time to **skip**, and you decide your learning pace.

### Part I: Data Structures

This section will get you started with basic Python code and data 
structures.

1. [Pythonic Functions](part_one/1-functions.html)
2. [Collections and Sequences](part_one/2-collections.html)
3. [Dictionaries](part_one/3-dictionaries.html)
4. [Iterators, Generators, Comprehensions](part_one/4-iterators.html)


### Part II: Classes and OOP

1. [Classes and OOP](part_two/1-classes.html)
2. [Modules](part_two/modules.html)
2. [Python Data Model](part_two/3-data-model.html)
3. [Function as Objects](part_two/4-functions-objects.html)
4. [Magic Methods](part_two/5-magic.html)
5. [Exceptions](part_two/6-exceptions.html)
6. [(Extra) Pythonic Coding Style](part_two/extra-pep8.html)
